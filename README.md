# IDS705: Introductory Machine Learning for Data Science

This repository contains exercises and assignments from Duke University IDS 705: Introduction to Machine Learning.
The exercises cover basic machine learning topics such as parametric vs. non-parametric models, the bias-variance tradeoff, and mathematical derivations of logistic regression.

Additionally, the exercises include classifiers and regressive models created from scratch to strengthen understanding of how the techniques work without the backing of a Python module.
